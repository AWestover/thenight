# unsolved problems
  * how do I decide what to show?
  * how do I draw the sight cones

# TODO
  * add obstacles (light will be hard)
  * add destroying players (or whatever it is called)
  * add eating food (hunger is a need)
  * add lanterns

# theland, done right
  * I want to fix one of the biggest flaws in theland with this game
  * in theland people each store their own data and tell it to other players
  * in thenight, the server stores player data and players can cause updates to this, and receive this information from the server
  * this makes so much more sense than my other model, which really only made sense for a 2 player game and even then not really...
