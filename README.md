# theland, done right
  * OK I want to fix one of the biggest flaws in theland with this game
  * in theland people each store their own data and tell it to other players
  * in thenight, the server stores player data and players can cause updates to this, and receive this information from the server
  * this makes sooo much more sense than my other model, which really only made sense for a 2 player game and even then not really...
